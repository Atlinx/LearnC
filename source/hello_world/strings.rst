A **character** is a symbol. 

In C, a character is written in single-quotes (``''``) surrounding the character.

A **string** is a sequence or "string" of characters. Strings are basically pieces of text.

In C, a string is written as double-quotes (``"``) surrounding some text.

.. admonition:: Ex.
    :class: example

    .. code-block:: c

        "the quick brown fox", 
        "it costs $599",
        "the weather today is nice"
