Installation
============

.. attention:: Please ensure that you have Godot installed before continuing. 
	You can download Godot `here <https://godotengine.org/download/>`_.

Go to the `releases page <https://github.com/Fractural/FracturalVisualNovelEngine/releases>`_ of the github repository for Fractural VNE.

Find the latest release (Should be the top most release) and download one of the two .zip files:
   
   * If you want C# support, then download ``MonoFracturalVNE.zip``
   
   * If you just need GDScript support, then download ``FracturalVNE.zip``

Then create a new Godot project or open an existing one. Afterwards, create a ``res://addons`` folder in your project if it does not already exist.

Unzip the downloaded zip file as a folder into ``res://addons``. This should leave you with a ``res://addons/FracturalVNE`` folder containing the plugin.

If you downloaded the Mono version of the plugin, make sure to rebuild the solution, which can be done by pressing the build button on the top left of the editor.
