What is Programming? ‚ùì
=======================

If you're learning about programming for the first time, you may wonder --- what exactly is programming?

Programming is making instructions that a computer can follow. Think of programs like a to-do list but for computers, where each instruction is another item on that list.

A program's instructions is called it's **source code** or **code** for short. Often times, you can't actually run code on it's own. This is because computers can only understand binary, which are lines of 1s and 0s. So we have to convert, or **compile**, our code into a **program** that can then run on out computer.
