About Programming ‚ùì
=======================

Before we start programming, we should define why programming matters and what it is.

Why Program?
------------

But why should you bother learning how to program? 

Well, programming gives you the power to create things -- whether it's a website, a video game, a social media platform, a stock trading bot, or an image recognition solution. Additionally, programming can help improve your critical thinking as it's very much a puzzle, often with more than one path to a solution. I hope you find the joy in programming after completing this guide.

What is Programming?
--------------------

Programming is making instructions or **programs** that a computer can follow. Think of programs like a to-do list but for computers, where each instruction is another item on that list. 

When a computer is following instructions of a program, we say that the computer is **running** the program.

A program's instructions is called it's **source code** or **code** for short. The file that contains these instructions is sometimes called the **source file**. In C, our source files end in ``".c"``. 

Often times, you can't actually run code on it's own because computers can only understand binary, which are lines of ones and zeros. Therfore we have to convert, or **compile**, our code into a **program** that can then run on our computers.
