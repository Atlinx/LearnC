strcmp ðŸ§µ
==============

If you want to check if two strings are equal, you cannot use ``==``. This is because strings are stored as a list of characters, so you must use some function that can go through every character in both strings and check if they are equal.

Lucky for us, this has already been written in the C language. We can use the ``strcmp()`` function to compare two strings alphabetically, by writing:

.. important::

    Functions themselves can also evaluate into a value! If a function does this, then we say the funciton **returns** a value. The return value of a function must always be the same type --- For exmaple if a function returns a float, then it must always return a float.

.. code-block:: c
    
    strcmp(string_1, string_2);

where

    ``string_1`` is the first string
    ``string_2`` is the second string

    This function returns

    - 0 if the two strings are equal
    - -1 if the ``string_1`` comes first alphabetically
    - 1 if the ``string_2`` comes first alphabetically 

The ``strcmp()`` function is actually part of the ``string.h`` library, so in order to use it, you must have ``#enclude <string.h>`` at the top of your program.
