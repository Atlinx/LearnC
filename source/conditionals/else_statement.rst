Else Statement ‚ùî
=================

What if you wanted to also check if the condition wasn't satisfied in an if statement? You may assume we would have to write out two if statements, like:

.. code-block:: c

    int condition = 0;

    if (condition) {
        
    }

    if (!condition) {
        
    }

However you can actual use the else statement instead:

.. code-block:: c

    int condition = 0;

    if (condition) {
        
    } else {
        
    }

You can also chain together ``else if`` to check for multiple conditions in one if statement chain.

.. code-block:: c

    int condition = 0;
    int other_condition = 1;
    int another_condition = 0;

    if (condition) {
        
    } else if (other_condition) {
        
    } else if (another_condition) {
        
    }

Note that you can only add the else at the very end of an if statement chain.

.. code-block:: c

    int condition = 0;
    int other_condition = 1;

    if (condition) {
        
    } else if (other_condition) {
        
    } else {

    }
