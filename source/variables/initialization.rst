Intialization ‚û°Ô∏è
=================

What if you wanted to declare and assign a value to a variable in just a single statement?

Well you can **initialize** a variable to give it an "initial" value. The syntax is as follows

    .. code-block:: c

        type var_name = value;

    ..

    where,

    ``type`` is the type of the variable.

    ``var_name`` is the name of the variable.

    ``value`` is the value you are intializaing the variable to.

.. caution::

    By default, C does not initialize a variable. If you only declare a varaible and then try to use it, your program will run behave unexpectedly!

    It's good practice to intialize every variable you declare to a value to avoid this problem.
