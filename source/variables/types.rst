Types ðŸ”¤
=========

A **type** in C is a representation of a certain "type" of data. Every value in C has a "type." Here are the list of the 3 common types we will be dealing with:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 50 30
    
    * - Name
      - Description
      - Examples
    * - Integer
      - Represents an integer.
      - 0, -10, 2, 150, -349
    * - Float
      - Represents a decimal number, with at most 7-8 decimal places.
      - 0, -10.43, 2.23420, 150.493, -349, -4230.340
    * - Character
      - Represents a single symbol.
      - 'a', 'D', '1', '#', '^', '%', '&'
    * - String
      - Represents a sequence of characters.
      - "hello world!", "the quick brown fox"

More on Strings
----------------

As you learned in Lesson 1, a sequence of characters is called a **string**. Although many programming languages have a dedicated string type, C does not.

.. note::
    The name "string" comes from using the word "string" to describe lists of objects, such "a string of beads". For the string type, it means "a string of characters".
