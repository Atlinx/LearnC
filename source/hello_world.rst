Hello World ðŸ‘‹
===============

The website should automatically have generated some C code when you'd opened it. If you are using your own editor, you can copy and paste th following text into your source file.

.. code-block:: c

	#include <stdio>

	int main() {
	    printf("Hello world!");
	    return 0;
	}

Run your code and you should see the text "Hello world!" printed to your output window!

But how this code actually works.

``main()``
**********

``main()`` is a function, which will be covered later. All you have to know for now is that this is the starting point of the program. Everything between the brackets of main will be ran when 

Note that you must include return

``printf()``
************

``printf()``` is also a function, and it displays or **prints** text to the output window. 

You can print text by passing in a **string**, which is a sequence of characters. You can write strings by wrapping text in double quotes

	**Ex.**
	
	.. code-block:: c

		"I'm a string!"
		"100 red apples"
		"The quick brown fox"
