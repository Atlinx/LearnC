Operators

Operators in C are symbols that tell the computer to perform a specific operation on some inputs. The inputs of an operator are called the **operands**.

Operators are taken primarily from math and logic. Here's a list of the math operators in C.

Modulo
^^^^^^

There is a special "remainder" operator called the **modulo** operator. It can be used to find the remainder after two integers.

.. admonition:: Ex.
	:class: example

	.. code-block:: c

		4 % 2 = 0		// 4 / 2 = 2 remainder 0
		3 % 2 = 1		// 3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1

		10 % 3 = 1		// 10 / 3 = 2 remainder 1
		11 % 3 = 2		// 11 / 3 = 2 remainder 2

|check| What does the modulo operator do?

	.. collapse:: Solution âœ…

		The modulo operator gets the remainder from dividng the first number by the second number

|check| What does the experssion ``3 % 2`` evaluate to?

	.. collapse:: Solution âœ…

		``7 % 2 = 1``, because 7 divided by 2 is 2 with a **remainder** of 1.
