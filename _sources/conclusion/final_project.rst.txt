Final Project - Text Adventure Game üéÆ
========================================

Now that you know the basics, it's finally time piece everything together! For our final project, we are going to make a text adventure game. 

This is a video game where you a shown text about story and can type a response to make different choices. It's basically a branching narrative that's driven by the users decisions.

.. |check| raw:: html

    <input type="checkbox">

|check| Ask the player for their name and store it in a variable. Assume that the player's name can be at most 63 characters long.


.. admonition:: Ex.
    :class: example

    .. code-block:: text

        > Please enter your name:
        > Bob
        > Welcome Bob to the world of Augustine!

..

    .. collapse:: Hint 1 ‚ùì

        You can create a string variable ``n`` characters long using ``char my_variable[n];``. See :doc:`/variables/string_variables` for more info.

    .. collapse:: Hint 2 ‚ùì

        You can get user input using ``scanf(format_string, &variable_1, &variable_2)``. See :doc:`/variables/scanf` for more info.

    .. collapse:: Solution ‚úÖ

        .. code-block:: c

            #include <stdio.h>

            int main() {
                // Step 1
                char name[64] = "";

                printf("Please enter your name:\n");
                scanf("%s", name);
                printf("Welcome %s to the world of Augustine!", name);
            }

|check| Ask the user to make a choice by typing in a single-word. After receiving input, using an if statement to make a branching path that prints something different depending on the user's choice.

.. admonition:: Ex.
    :class: example

    .. code-block:: text

        > Welcome Bob to the world of Augustine!
        > You're an outlander who has just arrived to a small habor city on the east of Augustine. 
          As you get off the boat, you get a whiff of the air --- you can almost taste the salty 
          sea mixed with the sweetness of local delicacies. You scan the boardwalk and 
          see a bar, a hotel, and a shop.
        > - Type 'shop' to enter the shop.
        > - Type 'hotel' to enter the hotel.
        > - Type 'bar' to enter the bar.
        > shop
        > You enter a shop to buy some goods. The prices are so low, what a steal! 
          Unfortunately you were careless and spent all your money. You're now broke...

        > - Type 'bar' to enter the bar.
        > bar
        > You enter the bar and you find some old friends sitting at a table in the corner.

    .. collapse:: Hint 1 ‚ùì

        You can compare two strings using the ``strcmp()`` function. Make sure you have ``#include <string.h>`` at the top of your program when you use it! See :doc:`/conditionals/strcmp` for more info.


    .. collapse:: Hint 2 ‚ùì

        You may want to use escape sequences to add in newlines or tabs to make your text more readable. See :doc:`/hello_world/escape_sequences` for more information.
